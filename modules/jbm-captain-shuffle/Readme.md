# Capatin Shuffle

## Overview
At the latter stages of the game I find it cumbersome to assign my best available captains to a fleet, so this simplifies things for me. Adds a new Dialogue to fleet commanders that will optimise a fleet with 'avalable' captains (service, marine and unassigned) that are more skilled than the current fleet pilots.

## Credits
SirNukes and the community that have maintained UI loading features. 
Egosoft - without the existing UI examples I would not have managed to figure this all out.

## Current status
Broken - it's not quite there. The dialog works, we can get a list of captains and potential employees that can be transferred, the actual crew exchange logic is a bit messy though and is where I am currently working through.
