# X4 Mod Mod-jbm-test

## Overview
This mod is intended to provide some additional small stories to add to the X4 experience to add some more vibrancy to the play experience beyond the standard mission types and open world exploration and trading. 

## Planned Scope
1. Help the Paranid Heretic. A Paranid Scientist has been branded a heretic by all Paranid factions. He needs your help in getting him somewhere safe for now and may need some help in the future.

2. Teladi profitsss! A young teladi entrepeneur has an idea for a new market and she's looking for a ship to escort her as she identifies sources of materials. 


## Status
* Attempting to build conditions to trigger stories. Need to review the process for random selection used for normal missions and adapt (my approach isn't quite working yet).

## Planned areas of improvement
1. *(Still need to get the actual scope done, improvements later)*

## Credits and other sources
Egosoft for X4 and the modding tools.
So far no other libraries are used for this mod, this may change and I'll update if/when this occurs. 


## Can I use this? 
This is a mod for [X4 Foundations](https://www.egosoft.com/games/x4/info_en.php),  You're welcome to leverage my code or what I've learned in your own tweaks and modifications to the X4 game, but you do so at your own risk. While I am careful to ensure that this mod only does what it should do, this is a side project and I cannot make any claims as to the security and stability of this release.

Please make sure you inspect this set of resources carefully and take particular care in invoking any scripts or commands with elevated rights.

If this *is* helpful or of value a mention of me and/or this repo would be nice, but isn't required.

Happy modding!
