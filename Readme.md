# X4 Mod Archive

## Overview
This is both my platform and my archive of X4 Mods.
A more detailed overview of the mods and documentation is available at:

https://joel-butler.github.io/x4mods/

These mods are enabled by Egosoft and inspired by various other modders. Of particular note: 


## Tools and Scripts
1. generatecats.bat - a batch file able to generate from a working install of X4 (and the presence of the X4 Catalog tool) the extracted resources required for modding.

2. webserver.bat - assuming successful export of cat data to .\cats and the presence of python this will run a local webserver allowing interactive use of the two html files present in the extracts - built from discussions on https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=181&t=432098#p4997854 and an example hosted here https://github.com/temetvince/template-x4-mod

3. Build.bat - creates an output folder stripping unncessary files such as XSD.
