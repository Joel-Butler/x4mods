# Capatin Shuffle

## Overview
At the latter stages of the game I find it cumbersome to assign my best available captains to a fleet, so this simplifies things for me. Adds a new Dialogue to fleet commanders that will optimise a fleet with 'avalable' captains (service, marine and unassigned) that are more skilled than the current fleet pilots.

## Credits
SirNukes and the community that have maintained UI loading features. 
Egosoft - without the existing UI examples I would not have managed to figure this all out.

## Current status
Almost there - initial tests appear positive but I'd like to clean up some of the Lua code, add some additional catches for errors and remove some of the debug and feedback output I have included while I was working this out.

## To-do
1. Add translations using machine generated translation data for now.
2. Adjust log data so that machine generated translation can be used as part of communication.
3. Clean up Lua code.
4. Finalise mod ids and name. 
5. Release.
